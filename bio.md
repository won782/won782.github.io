Hi! This is Won, and nice to meet you over cable fiber!

I graduated from [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu) [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.rice.edu), in 2014.
I was particuarly interested in various statistical learning theories and communicating insights succiently and gracefully.

I currently work at [Panorama Education](https://www.panoramaed.com), where we help radically improve student outcomes via data and analytics.

Besides looking at data, crunching numbers, thinking about various probabilities about both probable and improbable things in life,
I enjoy playing golf and skiing!

Before my life in Boston, I lived at Daegu, South Korea for most of my life, but also in Syndey, Australia, Athens, GA, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Gumi (South Korea), Houston, TX, and Kansas City, MO.

If you need any other information, please don't hesistate to contact me won782 [at] gmail [dot] com!
