So I am an avid skiier, at least converted recently.

I first skiied at age of 7 in South Korea, a now non-existant resort called **Alps**.

(I might want to talk more about ski resort industry in general in other post. I have lots to talk about this)
Ever since then, I would ski couple of days each winter until middle school.

As I entered boarding magnet school in Korea (Foreign Language High School), I didn't ski for that 3 years, and who would've imagined me ending up at Texas for college. That plus 2 years of military service took good 7~8 years off from my ski life.

With some fortune, I ended up in Boston, MA, not too far from *decent* east coast ski resorts. I honestly thought things couldn't get better before I visited places in the west.

So below are places I've been so far, until mid-late 2017-2018 season

That's not too bad given I only got back skiing 3 years ago.
Mostly next up in the list is Whistler Blackcomb, BC and Jackson Hole, WY.
