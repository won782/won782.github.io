So here it begins!

After long slackness and hiatus of 2 years or so, I am restarting my personal blog! This can serve as good learning experience as well as motiviating myself to learn more and consolidate my learnings.

### Contents
I will mostly talk about **data science**, **travel**, **sports via data**, and stuffs related to my **love for nifty gadgets**.

### Tech Stack
I purchased **Samsung Chromebook 3**![alt text](/assets/img/chromebook.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

just for the purpose of this blog. I've installed [**xfce**](https://xfce.org/) so that I can develop things in Linux environment. For $200, I now have solid 11 inch and 12 hour lasting perfect scripting toy!

So my Windows desktop is of great entertainment value, but is not suitable for development. My Macbook Pro is bulky, and does not have the best battery life - it is a over-overkill for simple scripting tasks.

Following things are used to power this website!
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)
* [Jekyll Crosspost to Medium](https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-crosspost-to-medium)

So finally, like Tiger Woods said :
