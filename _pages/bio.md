Hi! This is Won, and nice to meet you over cable fiber!

I graduated from [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu)  [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.rice.edu), in 2014.
I was particuarly interested in various statistical learning theories and communicating insights succiently and gracefully.

I am a data scientist at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com), as of April 2018. The impact on people's lives, sheer scale of the work, and opportunities to make positive changes to the world really excites me!

I previously worked at [Panorama Education](https://www.panoramaed.com), where I helped radically improve student outcomes via data and analytics.

Besides looking at data, crunching numbers, thinking about various probabilities about both probable and improbable things in life,
I enjoy playing golf and skiing!

Before my life in Boston, I lived at Daegu, South Korea for most of my life, but also in Syndey, Australia, Athens, GA, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Gumi (South Korea), Houston, TX, and Kansas City, MO.

To regurgitate above, you can look at brief [CV](CV), or Iif you need any other information, please don't hesistate to contact me won782 [at] gmail [dot] com!
