<p>Hi! This is Won, and nice to meet you over cable fiber!</p>

<p>I graduated from <a href="https://www.rice.edu">Rice University</a>  <a href="https://statistics.rice.edu">Department of Statistics</a>, in 2014.
I was particuarly interested in various statistical learning theories and communicating insights succiently and gracefully.</p>

<p>I currently work at <a href="https://www.panoramaed.com">Panorama Education</a>, where we help radically improve student outcomes via data and analytics.</p>

<p>Besides looking at data, crunching numbers, thinking about various probabilities about both probable and improbable things in life,
I enjoy playing golf and skiing!</p>

<p>Before my life in Boston, I lived at Daegu, South Korea for most of my life, but also in Syndey, Australia, Athens, GA, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Gumi (South Korea), Houston, TX, and Kansas City, MO.</p>
